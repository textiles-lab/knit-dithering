- yarn_measured_rayon_11.png is a set of eleven colors of rayon yarn measured by the paper authors.
- dithered-front.png and dithered-back.png are the result of co-dithering these two images (5 yarns selected from yarn_measured_ray_11, cross-within of 25, use-within of 9)
- knit-front.jpg and knit-back.jpg are photographs of the resulting knit.

Both Hokusai images have been scaled to account for the approximate stitch aspect ratio of generalized jacquard knitting (using thin rayon yarns on our lab's 15-guage machine).
